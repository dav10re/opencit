/**
 * This is a draft of the interface that Linux, Citrix, and Vmware
 * agents should implement for communicating information about their hosts
 * to Mt Wilson. THis will allow Mt Wilson to treat them uniformly and move
 * all the platform-specific calls and procedures into those agents in a 
 * clean way. 
 * 
 * To obtain a HostAgent object, use the HostAgentFactory to create one for a 
 * given host. All the methods in this interface apply to the given host.
 * 
 * All the methods in this interface are intended to retrieve information
 * from the host (or its master/manager server). 
 * 
 * Note that the HostAgent is not responsible for interpreting the attestation.
 * It is only responsible for obtaining the host information, AIK, TPM Quote,
 * and Module Manifest. The Attestation Service will interpret these.
 * 
 * The methods isTpmPresent(), isTpmEnabled(), isIntelTxtSupported(), and
 *  isIntelTxtEnabled() help the
 * attestation service provide detailed trust status to clients:
 * 
 * 1. Trusted  (host complies with assigned policies in whitelist)
 * 2. Untrusted (host does not comply with assigned policies in whitelist)
 * 3. Intel TXT Not Enabled (when isIntelTxtEnabled()==false)
 * 4. TPM Not Enabled (when isTpmEnabled()==false)
 * 5. TXT and TPM Not Enabled (when both isTpmEnabled()==false and isIntelTxtEnabled()==false)
 * 6. TXT Not Supported (when isIntelTxtSupported()==false)
 * 
 * if isIntelTxtSupported() and isIntelTxtEnabled() and isTpmPresent() and isTpmEnabled() then
 *      ... evaluate policies to determine trusted or untrusted ...
 *      ... actually isIntelTxtSupported() is implied by isIntelTxtEnabled() ...
 *      ... and isTpmPresent() is implied by isTpmEnabled() ...
 * else
 *      ... host trust status is unknown ...
 *      if isIntelTxtSupported() == false then display #6
 *      else if isIntelTxtEnabled() == false && isTpmEnabled() == false then display #5
 *      else if isIntelTxtEnabled() == false then display #3
 *      else if isTpmEnabled() == false then display #4
